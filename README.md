# Multigame
A simple SourceMod plugin that allows you to define gamemodes in `multigame.cfg` (addons/sourcemod/configs) and vote to switch between them.

Feel free to modify, commit, pull request or use this in your own plugins.

## Only allowing admins to switch gamemodes 
If you want to disable player voting use must set the **multi_enable_vote** ConVar in `tf/cfg/sourcemod/multigame.cfg`.
